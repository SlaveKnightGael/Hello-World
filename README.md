# Hello-World

Hello evereyone

SKG here, I'm currently teaching myself C++. I'm also on freeCodeCamp and aim to complete the front end dev training and move on to the next certificate. My goal is to work in the gaming industry and run my own business. I enjoy watching anime, playing video games, drawing, painting and working out. I'd like to be able to travel the world some day
